        <p><strong>Clearing Neighborhood History:</strong></p>
        <p>The history of Clearing begins shrouded in mystery. An anomalous subdivision began showing up in maps as early as 1870.
            Local author and historian Robert Hill calls this the "Lost Village". This subdivision appears between present day Nashville
            and Narragansett and between 59th and 63rd streets. Though when names appear, they are different from what they are currently.
            For example, Narragansett is Major. The area gets its name from the fact that farm goods from the area were "cleared" (delivered)
            through the airport and railroad yards. Clearing was first incorporated as a town in 1912, within the Township of Stickney.
            The Clearing area quickly became a part of Chicago in 1915 because the growing population needed services provided by the city.
            It is bordered on the west by Harlem Avenue, on the east by railroad tracks just east of Cicero Ave., to the North by 59th street
            and to the south by 65th street. The southern portion of Midway Airport is in Clearing.</p>
